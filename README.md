Loan Eligibility Prediction for Dream Housing Finance

Overview

Dream Housing Finance Company offers home loans across urban, semi-urban, and rural regions. 
Customers apply for loans, and the company validates their eligibility based on various personal and financial details. 
The goal of this project is to automate the loan eligibility process using customer data, enabling real-time predictions of loan approval.

Problem Statement

Dream Housing Finance aims to automate their loan eligibility process based on customer data such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others.
This automation will help the company target eligible customers more efficiently.

The performance of your model will be evaluated using Accuracy.Your predictions for loan status in the test dataset (test.csv) will be compared against the actual loan status values.
The submission file should contain the predicted loan status (Loan_Status) for each Loan_ID.

Approach

1)Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numeric features.
2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform univariate and bivariate analysis to identify patterns and relationships between features.
3)Model Development: Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict loan eligibility.
4)Model Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy on the test dataset.
5)Prediction: Generate predictions for the test dataset and submit them for evaluation.
